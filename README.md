# Posturku
A programmer often uses a computer/laptop for a long time. This can cause health problems if they do not apply proper posture and set rest periods. Therefore, it is essential to adopt a healthy lifestyle regarding posture and rest, but they find it challenging to be disciplined in practicing it. They usually do not realize the incorrect posture they did while using a computer/laptop. This got us thinking about using the existing technology to help programmers be disciplined and understand the incorrect posture without studying tedious tutorials. Therefore, We want to create an Android mobile application that can monitor a programmer's body posture over a certain period by using a camera. This application will take pictures every 10 minutes and send them to the cloud to be processed using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. If the processing results find an incorrect posture, the application will provide real-time notification to the user so that they are aware of the incorrect posture that was made and immediately fix it. With this solution, programmers can reduce the risk of health and posture problems and increase productivity.
