# Posturku
<p> an Android mobile application that can monitor a programmer's body posture over a certain period by using a camera. This application will take pictures every 10 minutes and send them to the cloud to be processed using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. If the processing results find an incorrect posture, the application will provide real-time notification to the user so that they are aware of the incorrect posture that was made and immediately fix it. With this solution, programmers can reduce the risk of health and posture problems and increase productivity.<p>
